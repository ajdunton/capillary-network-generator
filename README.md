# Capillary Network Generator

This program creates a representation of *capillary infrastructure, which we define as the small-scale infrastructure that connect to every building. Specifically in the implemented program, we generate combined sewer networks. Modifications may be made to generate other types of capillary infrastructure.

# Procedure
The following is a brief overview of the procedure that is implemented in script.py. Note that params.py and funcs.py are modules that are imported into script.py. These modules contain parameters/constants and functions, respectively. 

See [REF] for further details about the implemented procedure and validation for a case study location.
